## About

I recently defended my doctoral dissertation  in physical oceanography at
[Scripps Institution of Oceanography][scripps], University of California San Diego. I'll
soon join the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution][whoi] as a postdoctoral scholar. As an ocean dynamicist, 
I combine theory, observations, and computer simulations to study how the ocean flows
and shapes the climate. My recent research has targeted the turbulent and wavy
dynamics of the upper ocean at horizontal scales between 1-300 km.
You can find more about me on my [vitae][cv].
