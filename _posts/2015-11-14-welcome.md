Hi there. I'm Cesar B. Rocha. I'm a world citizen, human-being with his 
ambitions, virtues and limitations.  I was brought up to a middle class family and
grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil. My ancestry speaks to the Brazilian diversity: I'm a 
mix up of Portuguese, Austriac, and Japanese people. Yes, I'm 25% Japanese: my 
grandmother's family fled Japan in the 1930's.

My most lively childhood memories are of long hours of swim practice and of 
swimming competitions across Sao Paulo state. I started swimming on a daily basis at the age of 5. 
And I believe my very first competition happened when I was 8 (I retired at the age of 14) –
most of my loyal friendships stem from that petit swimming team.

I attended college at the [Universidade de Sao Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_São_Paulo),
 USP, Brazil. At USP, I've made awesome friends and fell in love with applied mathematics, data science, and free software. 
 While I was studying science, I've made a lot of friends in the humanities.  Being a student in a gigantic and diverse public university in Brazil changed my life. When I was freshman, I had a 
  self-centered perspective of life: the
  traditional selfish upper middle class naive view of the world. Hagging out with my friends from humanities turned
  out to be a priceless opportunity for personal growth and discovery.
  This may sound cliché but I’m committed to apply my skills to improve the world.

 In 2012 I was a visiting student at [UMass Dartmouth](http://www.umassd.edu) 
 in the south coast of Massachusetts. (I had been visiting
 UMass since early 2010.) In Massachusetts I could enjoy small pleasures in life:
  an inspiring [research advisor](http://www.umassd.edu/engineering/mne/people/facultyandstaff/amittandon/),
  picking up vegetables in a organic farm every Friday afternoon with a buddy, and
  a colorful early Fall in New England. 

I moved to Southern California about two years ago to do my PhD at 
[UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). And I love it there! The weather is mild
all year and people are really nice in La Jolla. If I could choose, I think I would
pick SoCal to settle down.

In my free time I enjoy listening to music, reading, biking, surfing, and swimming. Among other things, 
I’m a big fan of 
[Jorge Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPENGb-FG5E), [jazzy Bossa Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmOD7ayA1y8), [piano performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s), [Jose Saramago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Saramago), [Gabriel Garcia Marques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_Márquez), [Guimaraes Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/João_Guimarães_Rosa), and [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com).

Moving ahead, I look forward to learn Chinese and to play saxophone. I'm also planning on joining the UCSD triathlon team.

Thanks for reading.
