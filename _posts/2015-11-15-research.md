I am a scientist studying oceanography at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu),
 [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). As a physical oceanography, I strive to understand how the ocean works,
  and its relation to the climate system. In particular, I seek to characterize the structure and dynamics of highly energetic flows
  in the upper ocean such as coherent vortical structures, quasi-linear waves, and turbulent cascades. 

In my research,  I try to break
  artificial barriers that separate theory, high-performance computing, and analysis of observations
  in oceanography. It is time to move past silly statements like "I do not believe in models" or "these theories have not to do with the real ocean". The solution to the great scientific problems of the 21st century will require a judicious combination theory, computational modeling, and observations.  In fact, in my research, I strive to integrate methods and practices of applied mathematics, fluid mechanics, environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics, high-performance computing, and big data.

While I focus on problems, I do spend significant fraction of my time working on methods. There is value in
 producing version-controlled, unit-tested software. It is important to understand the details of how a particular
 instrument works.
