I'm an scientist studying oceanography at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu),
 [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). As a physical oceanography, I strive to understand how the ocean works,
  and its relation to the climate system. In particular, I seek to understand the dynamics of turbulent flows
  in the upper ocean.

  In my research, I tend to focus on problem, not methods. In particular, I try to break
  artificial barriers that separate theory, high-performance computing, and analysis of observations
  in oceanography. It is time to move past silly statements like `I do not believe in models`. The solution to the great scientific problems of the 21st century will require a judicious combination theory, computational modeling, and observations.  
    
    I'm also interested in applied mathematics, data science, fluid mechanics, environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics, high-performance computing, and big data. I do not see these topics as separate fields. Instead, I actively
    incorporate their practices and method into my research in oceanography.
