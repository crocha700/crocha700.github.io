I am a scientist studying oceanography at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu),
 [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). As a physical oceanography, I strive to understand how the ocean works,
  and its relation to the climate system. In particular, I seek to understand the dynamics of turbulent flows
  in the upper ocean.

  In my research, I tend to focus on problem, not methods. In particular, I try to break
  artificial barriers that separate theory, high-performance computing, and analysis of observations
  in oceanography. It is time to move past silly statements like "I do not believe in models". The solution to the great scientific problems of the 21st century will require a judicious combination theory, computational modeling, and observations.  
    
    I am also interested in applied mathematics, data science, fluid mechanics, environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics, high-performance computing, and big data. I do not see these topics as separate fields. Instead, I actively incorporate their practices and method into my research in oceanography.
