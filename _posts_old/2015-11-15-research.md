I am a scientist studying oceanography at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu),
 [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). As a physical oceanographer, I strive to understand how the ocean works,
  and its relation to climate. In particular, my PhD thesis focus on characterizing the structure and dynamics of unsteady flows
  such as coherent vortices, jets, waves, and turbulent cascades. Specifically, I have been thinking about the partition of the upper ocean
  variability into nonlinear vortical flows and quasi-linear waves, and the stirring and mixing due to these flows. My research advisor is 
  [Bill Young](http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~wryoung), with whom I've been spending a lot of time solving problems on a chalkboard since the beginning of year 2
  at Scripps. [Teri Chereskin](http://tryfan.ucsd.edu
) and [Sarah Gille](http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~sgille/
) have been informally co-advising me since year 1.

Goals of my research are to develop a qualitative understanding of the ocean and its relation to climate and (ii) to bridge the gap
between theory and observations/comprehensive models.


In my research,  I attempt to break
  artificial barriers that separate theory, high-performance computing, and analysis of observations. It is time to move past silly statements like "I do not use models" or "these theories have nothing to do with the real ocean". The solution to the great scientific problems of the 21st century requires a synergy of theoretical, computational, and observational efforts.  In fact, I strive to integrate methods and practices of applied mathematics, fluid mechanics, environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics, high-performance computing, and big data.

I focus on solving scientific puzzles, but I do spend significant fraction of my time working on methods. It is very important to 
 produce version-controlled, unit-tested software. It is valuable to understand the details of how a particular
 instrument works. It is essential to test different numerical methods and algorithms (and to come up with new ones).
  And it is vital to perform sensitivity analyses. 

I am an advocate of reproducible science, and I share code and data associated with my research papers (e.g., see my recent [paper](http://git.io/vBe3H)). [The future of research communication is on the browser](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261). I use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks on a daily basis to share code, data, plots, and text with my advisors and collaborators.

While I'm formally done with classes, I'm always brushing up my knowledge and learning new material through [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)s. Moving forward, I'm keen to improve my skills in applied
mathematics, and to learn about numerical optimization and machine learning.

I am thankful to the Brazilian and American people for giving me the opportunity to spend my time thinking about the natural world. I pledge to be responsible with tax-payer resources. And I'm committed to use the best practices to produce useful and reproducible knowledge, thereby advancing, promoting, and protecting science and technology.

At Scripps, my research has been supported by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov) and the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov).  I'm also thankful for the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Fellowship](https://www.whoi.edu/gfd/) that is also supported by NSF. While at USP and UMass Dartmouth, I received funds from [Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo](http://fapesp.br).
