My new academic Web site is now up and running! While I had flashy Web sites in the past, minimalist design fits this new stage of my career perfectly.

This Web site builds on <ins>[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)</ins>, a fantastic 
Jekyll theme for academics. <ins>[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)</ins> is a static site generator. It is 
easy to hack and has useful extensions. My favorite Jekyll extension is <ins>[jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar)</ins>, which makes creating a page of publications painless. As with my previous page, I publish this Web site through github pages. To work around Github's lack of support for Jekyll plugins, I build the Web site locally and publish it static following <ins>[this hack](http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html)</ins>.

A few pages and features of this Web site are still under development. I haven't added 
a full description of my research interests and projects. Neither 
have I listed my publications in the gray literature. I will finish those pages in the next couple of weeks.
