I'm an oceanographer with active research efforts in an array of
topics of ocean physics, including western boundary currents, mesoscale and submesoscale dynamics, and internal waves.
I earned in 2018 a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from <ins>[Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://www.scripps.ucsd.edu)</ins>,
University of California San Diego. From 2018 to 2020, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar

In fall 2020 I joined the <ins>[University of Connecticut](https://www.uconn.edu)</ins> as
an Assistant Professor in the Department of Marine Sciences, where I'm starting
