I'm seeking motivated graduate students to join my
research group. Please reach out to me ([cesar.rocha At uconn.edu](cesar.rocha@uconn.edu)) if you are
interested in physical oceanography. Check out our active
research <ins>[projects](../research)</ins> and review the steps for applying to our
<ins>[graduate program](https://marinesciences.uconn.edu/academic/apply-grad/)</ins> in oceanography.

If you are an undergrad looking for training in data analysis  or computer modeling
or applied fluid mechanics, a research experience
in my group could be well-suited for you. No prior experience in physical oceanography is required.
Contact me if interested.


*I'm committed to building a diverse and inclusive research group, and I strongly
encourage applications from women and minority groups underrepresented in physical oceanography.*
