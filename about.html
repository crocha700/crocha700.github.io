## About

I'm a third-year PhD student in the Climate-Ocean-Atmosphere Program at
[Scripps Institution of Oceanography][scripps], University of California, San Diego.
As an oceanographer, I strive to understand the physical aspects of the ocean and
its role in the climate system.

I grew up in São Paulo in the southeast of Brazil. I went to school at
[University of Sao Paulo][usp] (USP), where I've met awesome friends and I fell
in love with applied mathematics, data science, and free software. At USP I also developed
a strong sense of fairness and social justice. This may sound  cliché but I'm committed to apply
my skills to improve the world.

In my free time I enjoy listening to music, reading, biking, surfing, and swimming.
I'm a big fan of Jorge Ben, jazzy Bossa Nova, piano concerts, Portuguese literature,
and The New Yorker.
