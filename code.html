## Code

I strive to write high-quality, well-tested, and well-documented code.
I'm an advocate of free software. All my codes are under version control, and
I contribute to several open source projects.
I'm core developer for [pyqg](http://pyqg.readthedocs.org/en/stable/), a pythonic
pseudo-spectral code to solve the quasigeostrophic equations.
Checkout my repositories on [github](https://github.com/crocha700), and ping me
if you have any questions.

I'm a member of NumFOCUS (open code, better science), I agree with
[Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/gallery/reproducibility-pi-manifesto/), and
I endorse the  [science code manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org). I wrote the [Open Science Graduate Student Manifesto
](https://medium.com/@crocha700/the-open-science-graduate-student-manifesto-f785b38d7b70#.nvmw685c7).
