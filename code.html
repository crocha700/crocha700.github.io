## Code

I strive to produce high quality, well-tested code.
I'm an advocate of free software. All my codes are under version control.
I contribute to open source projects, and
 I'm core developer for [pyqg](http://pyqg.readthedocs.org/en/stable/).
Checkout my repositories on [github](https://github.com/crocha700), and ping me
if you have any questions.

I'm a member of NumFOCUS (open code, better science), I agree with
[Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/gallery/reproducibility-pi-manifesto/), and
I endorse the  [science code manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org).
