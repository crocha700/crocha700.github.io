## Code

For a study to be reproducible, computer code must be tested, documented, and shared.
All my codes are under version control and I contribute to several open source projects.
Checkout my repositories on [github](https://github.com/crocha700) and the links
to code on my publication list.

I'm a member of NumFOCUS (open code, better science), I agree with
[Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/gallery/reproducibility-pi-manifesto/), and
I endorse the  [science code manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org).
