## Code

I strongly believe scientists must share code and data.
Check out my repositories on [github](https://github.com/crocha700) and the links
on my publication list.

I'm also an advocate for open and free software–––I'm a member of NumFOCUS (open code, better science), I agree with
[Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/gallery/reproducibility-pi-manifesto/), and
I endorse the  [science code manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org).
