Upper-ocean dynamics concerns the study of the causes and consequences of flows in the ocean mixed layer
and upper pycnocline, including eddies, fronts, filaments, waves, and turbulence. Understanding the dynamics of 
these flows is critical for understanding and predicting climate because the upper ocean connects the atmosphere
(where humans are pumping greenhouse gases) to the deep ocean, where most of the excess heat those gases trap end up. 

I'm particularly interested in submesoscale flows in the upper ocean.  Those are 0.1-10 km eddies and fronts and 
filaments associated with large vertical velocities. I'm part of the <ins>[Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment](https://espo.nasa.gov/s-mode)</ins> (S-MODE), a NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-3 (EVS-3) mission that aims to test the hypothesis that submesoscale ocean dynamics make important contributions to the vertical exchange of climate and biological tracers in the upper ocean. S-MODE field efforts will occur in the California Current, consisting of a two-week pilot experiment, likely in fall 2021, and two month-long intensive operations periods (IOPs) in the following years.

As part of S-MODE, we will deploy an array of saildrones in kilometer-scale
formation. [Saildrones](https://www.saildrone.com) are robotic sailboats developed by
rigged with atmospheric and oceanic sensors. Critical observations in S-MODE are velocity profiles
from ADCP on saildrones. These will yield unprecedented estimates of submesoscale velocity gradients.
Cesar is leading this saildrone effort, and there are opportunities for
students to work with him on S-MODE data.

I was also involved in the Saildrone component of the <ins>[Atlantic Tradewind Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Interaction Campaign](https://psl.noaa.gov/atomic/)</ins> (ATOMIC), led by Chelle Gentemann. As part of ATOMIC, we deployed three saildrones off French Guiana, Suriname and Guyana, where they criss-crossed North Brazil Current Rings. I'm using  ATOMIC saildrone data to study submesoscale velocity gradients and fronts in the tropics.

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images. -->

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
