<!-- The [Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment](https://espo.nasa.gov/s-mode) (S-MODE) is a NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-3 (EVS-3) mission. S-MODE will use measurements from a novel combination of platforms and instruments, along with data analysis and modeling, to test the hypothesis that submesoscale ocean dynamics make important contributions to vertical exchange of climate and biological variables in the upper ocean. This will require coordinated application of newly-developed in situ and remote sensing techniques, and it will provide an unprecedented view of the physics of submesoscale eddies and fronts and their effects on vertical transport in the upper ocean. S-MODE will take place in the California Current. The experiment consists of a two-week pilot experiment, in fall 2020, and two month-long intensive operations periods (IOPs), one in fall 2021 and the other in spring 2021.

As part of S-MODE, we will deploy an array of saildrones in kilometer-scale
formation. [Saildrones](https://www.saildrone.com) are robotic sailboats developed by
rigged with atmospheric and oceanic sensors. Critical observations in S-MODE are velocity profiles
from ADCP on saildrones. These will yield unprecedented estimates of submesoscale velocity gradients.
**Cesar is leading this saildrone effort,** and there are opportunities for
students to work with him on S-MODE data. -->

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images. -->

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
