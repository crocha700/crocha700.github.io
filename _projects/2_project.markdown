With length scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers and timescales of several days to several months, mesoscale eddies contain most of the kinetic of the ocean. Mesoscale eddies are critical to the equilibration of the large-scale ocean circulation and contribute most of the lateral stirring and mixing of ocean biogeochemical tracers and other climate-relevant ocean properties

In the past 15 years, many adavances have been made in mapping and characterizing the averaged properties of mesoscale eddies on a global scale. But many fundamental details of mesoscale eddies remain poorly studied in several regions of the world ocean. We are using a synergistic observational approach–– altimetric products, ships of opportunity, and Argo floats––to produce the most comprehensive look yet into mesoscale eddies in the Brazil Current region, with a focus on understanding the partition between local versus remotely generated eddies.
